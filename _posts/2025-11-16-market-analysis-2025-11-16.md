## Executive Summary
The crypto market shows risk-on rotation with total market cap at $3.37T and Bitcoin dominance at 57.1%. Layer-2 and privacy-related assets outperformed today, led by Starknet (STRK) surging +41.35%, while select token-specific names, including SOON (-22.05%), weighed on activity.

## Market Overview
Today’s aggregate market capitalization sits at $3.37 trillion, with Bitcoin controlling 57.1% of capital allocation. Bitcoin is trading at $96,439 and Ether at $3,236.75. The concentration of market cap in Bitcoin, combined with meaningful outperformance among specific altcoin sectors, suggests a market environment where capital is selectively rotating: large-cap stability underpins risk appetite while traders hunt higher relative returns in Layer‑2s and other niche plays.

## Top Performers
- Starknet (STRK) was the standout mover, rallying +41.35% to $0.231651. As a Layer‑2 protocol, STRK’s surge aligns with broad L2 strength today and likely reflects renewed attention on scaling narratives and developer-focused flows. The size of the move points to concentrated buying pressure, short-covering, or a catalyst-driven re-rating; traders should verify on-chain and news sources for token-specific events.
- aelf (ELF) rose +23.47% to $0.134815, joining the medium-cap rebound cohort. Such moves often stem from liquidity rotation and speculative positioning, particularly when larger systemic drivers are stable.
- Telcoin (TEL) gained +20.65% to $0.00662749 and Verge (XVG) climbed +17.08% to $0.00788248. Telcoin’s rally may reflect renewed interest in payment-oriented tokens, while Verge’s outperformance sits consistent with the privacy sector’s strong session.
- Decred (DCR) advanced +15.62% to $36.14, highlighting that a mix of governance- or Bitcoin-adjacent projects can attract flows when traders seek alternatives to top-cap tokens.

Actionable insight: for traders, high-single- to double-digit gainers often show elevated intraday volatility and lower liquidity. Consider scaled position sizing and targets, and confirm catalyst validity before initiating exposure.

## Market Challenges
- SOON (SOON) led decliners with a -22.05% drop to $2.05, the largest single-asset pullback. Losses of this magnitude point to either token-specific negative news, distribution from whales, or failed technical setups.
- Concordium (CCD) fell -10.63% to $0.0250079, and Alchemist AI (ALCH) was down -8.63% to $0.146348. Notably, ALCH’s decline contrasts with the modestly positive AI sector overall, signaling idiosyncratic pressure.
- Other smaller-cap tokens — Non‑Playable Coin (NPC) and Plume (PLUME) — also moved lower, which is typical in intra-day profit-taking or liquidity-driven sell-offs.

Actionable insight: watch on-chain flows and concentrated holders for these tickers. When a few assets show outsized weakness versus the broader market, risk of contagion to correlated small-cap subsets increases.

## Sector Analysis
- Layer‑2 (L2): +7.49% (7 coins tracked) — the strongest sector performance today, with Starknet driving much of the upside. L2s are receiving capital as traders price in scaling narratives and fee-efficiency advantages.
- Privacy: +7.25% (6 coins tracked) — privacy-focused tokens outperformed, coinciding with Verge’s strong move.
- DeFi: +2.18% (10 coins tracked) — steady gains, suggesting continued interest in yield and protocol utility without a broad DeFi euphoria.
- Layer‑1 (L1): +1.32% (9 coins tracked) — modest strength, indicating selective rotation rather than broad L1 leadership.
- RWA (Real‑World Assets): +1.53% (8 coins tracked) — measured gains consistent with investor appetite for yield-bearing, less speculative token classes.
- AI: +0.81% (9 coins tracked) — marginally positive but mixed, with winners and losers inside the cohort.
- Meme: +1.38% (5 coins tracked) and Gaming: +0.33% (7 coins tracked) — low-to-moderate moves, suggesting these risk-on plays were not the focus today.

Interpretation: capital concentrated into infrastructure and privacy niches hints at a market that is comfortable taking risk but doing so selectively. L2 and privacy strength can be early rotation signals ahead of broader altcoin cycles.

## Technical Analysis (Qualitative)
- Bitcoin at $96,439: price concentration and a 57.1% dominance imply that Bitcoin continues to be the anchor asset. Momentum appears constructive given the absence of major capitulation signals; however, traders should treat the market as range-sensitive with potential for sharp intra-session moves tied to macro headlines.
- Ethereum at $3,236.75: Ether’s level supports ongoing activity in L2 ecosystems; the relative outperformance of L2 tokens suggests traders are positioning for execution-layer scaling benefits rather than base-layer leverage.
- Momentum and trend strength: sector leadership in L2s and privacy coins indicates sectoral momentum rather than broad market thrust. This is characteristic of an environment where liquidity chases thematic winners. Volatility is elevated for mid- and small-cap tokens; risk is asymmetric.
- Risk profile: elevated dispersion between top gainers and losers increases idiosyncratic risk. Use tighter risk controls, position limits, and stop discipline on smaller-cap trades.

Note: No explicit support/resistance dollar levels are provided beyond the prices listed above; traders should use their charts for precise technical levels.

## Market Outlook — What to Watch
- Monitor L2 narrative continuity: further gains in L2s could attract more capital away from large caps and broaden altcoin leadership.
- Watch Bitcoin dominance and liquidity flows: a rising dominance would imply capital concentrating back into BTC; a falling dominance with continued altcoin strength could signal a broader alt cycle.
- News/catalyst scanning for large moves (STRK, SOON): confirm whether token-specific events (protocol upgrades, incentive programs, listings) underpin moves to avoid trading on single-session volatility without context.
- Macro and regulatory headlines: sudden macro shifts or regulation-related announcements can rapidly alter risk appetite; keep stop levels and exposure aligned to conviction.

## Key Takeaways
- Total market cap is $3.37T with Bitcoin dominance at 57.1%; BTC is trading at $96,439 and ETH at $3,236.75.  
- Layer‑2s and privacy assets led gains — L2 sector +7.49%, Privacy +7.25% — driven by Starknet’s +41.35% rally.  
- Single-name volatility remains high: SOON plunged -22.05%, highlighting idiosyncratic risk among smaller caps.  
- Traders should favor selective, catalyst-backed positions, apply disciplined risk management, and watch BTC dominance and L2 flows for signals of broader rotation.
